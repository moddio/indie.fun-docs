Any projects are welcome to fundraise on indie.fun!

**What is indie.fun?**
Indie.fun is a project launchpad that helps indie developers fundraise faster and more efficiently. Creators can raise funds directly from their community using a token launch. Anyone can submit a project. No demo required, no technology or game engine requirements. Developers retain full creative control, and players can support projects they love transparently, with tokens that fuel the in-project economy. Indie.fun is built for people actually building.

**What is Moddio?**
Moddio is a no-code project engine for creating and launching multiplayer based projects. With built-in multiplayer tools, cross-platform compatibility, and Web3 features, Moddio makes it easy to focus on creativity while projects are instantly playable on any device. Check out our docs and start building: [learn.modd.io](http://learn.modd.io/)

Moddio is optional - you can use **any engine or project technology** to launch a token on indie.fun.

**What is a token?**
A token is a digital currency that powers the in-project economy. Think of it like Roblox's Robux—it’s used by players to buy items, unlock features, or participate in projectplay. On Indie.fun, tokens also serve as a fundraising tool: backers can purchase tokens to support developers early, and developers receive instant funding to bring their project to life. Tokens are unique to each project, giving creators full control over their economy while building a stronger connection between the community and the project.
