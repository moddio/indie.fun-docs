Any projects are welcome to fundraise on indie.fun!

**What is indie.fun?**
Indie.fun is a project launchpad that helps indie developers fundraise faster and more efficiently. Creators can raise funds directly from their community using a token launch, and allow players to actually experience the project firsthand with a working demo. Developers retain full creative control, and players can support projects they love transparently, with tokens that fuel the in-project economy.

**What is Moddio?**
Moddio is a no-code project engine for creating and launching multiplayer browser-based projects. With built-in multiplayer tools, cross-platform compatibility, and Web3 features, Moddio makes it easy to focus on creativity while projects are instantly playable on any device. Check out our docs and start building: [learn.modd.io](http://learn.modd.io/)

**What kinds of projects are allowed?**
projects must be browser-based projects.

**What is a token?**
A token is a digital currency that powers the in-project economy. Think of it like Roblox's Robux—it’s used by players to buy items, unlock features, or participate in projectplay. On Indie.fun, tokens also serve as a fundraising tool: backers can purchase tokens to support developers early, and developers receive instant funding to bring their project to life. Tokens are unique to each project, giving creators full control over their economy while building a stronger connection between the community and the project.
