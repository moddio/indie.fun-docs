## What is indie.fun?
Indie.fun is a game launchpad that helps indie developers fundraise faster and more efficiently. Creators can raise funds directly from their community using a token launch, and allow players to actually experience the game firsthand with a working demo. Developers retain full creative control, and players can support projects they love transparently, with tokens that fuel the in-game economy.

## What kinds of games are allowed?
Games must be browser-based games.

## What is a token?
A token is a digital currency that powers the in-game economy. Think of it like Roblox's Robux—it’s used by players to buy items, unlock features, or participate in gameplay. On Indie.fun, tokens also serve as a fundraising tool: backers can purchase tokens to support developers early, and developers receive instant funding to bring their game to life. Tokens are unique to each game, giving creators full control over their economy while building a stronger connection between the community and the game.
