# Marketing Boost

Indie.fun offers built-in marketing tools to help creators increase visibility, attract backers, and boost engagement for the fundraising window.

One of our core tools is **Yapping for Points**, a system that rewards users for posting about your project on X (Twitter). This can lead to increased awareness, more community interaction, and help with your fundraise.

---

## Yapping for Points

"Yapping" refers to users posting about your project on X. When they do, they earn **Yap Points**, which can help them gain Whitelist access or win rewards.

All Yapping activity is tracked and displayed under the **Community** tab of your Indie.fun project page.

---

### How It Works

- Users post on X with your campaign tags
- Our platform automatically detects these posts
- Based on the account's quality, reach, and engagement, users are awarded Yap Points
- Yap Points are shown publicly on the leaderboard
- Creators can optionally run raffles or giveaways tied to these scores

> Accounts with higher potential to help your project (based on our internal scoring system) will receive more points. Fake or low-engagement accounts will receive fewer.

### For Creators

To enable Yapping and other community tools:

- Go to the **Edit Project** page  
- Request access to **Marketing Boost** by contacting Indie.fun
- Once approved, you’ll unlock access to customize your campaign

---

### Tag Setup

In the Marketing Boost section, you can define the X tags or keywords we should track. For example:

- `$BNTY`
- `@indiedotfun`
- Your project name or token symbol

These tags will be used to automatically detect qualifying posts on X.

---

### Leaderboard + Community Page

All Yapping activity is shown on your **Community** page:

- XP Points (based on overall platform)
- Yap Points (based on X posts for your specific project)
- Total Score (used for raffles and ranking)
- Spam Reports (flagged for review)

---

### Running Raffles

You can incentivize Yapping by running raffles:

- In the **Marketing Boost** section, click **Run Raffle**
- Set the number of winners
- The system uses each user’s **Total Score** as weighted entries (e.g., 1,000 points = 1,000 tickets)
- Winners are displayed automatically under the **Raffle Results** tab
- Winners are automatically added to your project’s Whitelist and excluded from future raffles

### Yap for Solana

You can also reward Yapping with real SOL:

- In the Marketing Boost section, go to **Send Yapping Score to BountyHunt**
- You can customize the number of winners, how much SOL to each, and other options on [BountyHunt.fun](https://bountyhunt.fun)
- Top-scoring users will be paid automatically
