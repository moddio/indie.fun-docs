# Your guide into web3 gaming and successful launch on Indie.fun

### **The basics overview:**

**What is crypto**  
Crypto (short for “cryptocurrency”) refers to digital currencies that run on a decentralized network, known as a blockchain. Because it’s decentralized, no single company or government controls it. People can send and receive crypto directly—like digital cash—without needing a bank in the middle.

**What is a wallet**  
A wallet is like a digital account that holds your crypto, but you control it through a private key (a secret code). This key proves you own the assets in your wallet, and it’s essential for making transactions. Wallets can be software-based (mobile/desktop apps) or hardware devices that keep your keys offline for extra security. It is ESSENTIAL you do not share your private key with anyone\! Doing so will likely lead to loss of funds stored in the wallet. Since crypto is decentralized with no middleman to help recover the funds.

**What is web3 gaming**   
Web3 gaming is an umbrella term that covers any sort of game using the blockchain in one way or another. What most web3 games have in common is they empower the users to hold and trade their in-game items or tokens. This is a spectrum that can span from a simple NFT integration to more of the game logic stored blockchain. In the case of indie.fun it is very lightweight. There is a crypto token that users can spend in the game or speculate on.

**What are memecoins / tokens** 

The distinction between tokens and memecoins can be subjective based on usage. 

**Utility tokens**: These are digital assets created on a blockchain (like Ethereum or Solana). They can represent anything from a simple digital currency like USD or to access rights in an app. 

**Memecoins**: A category of tokens inspired by internet culture or memes (e.g., Dogecoin). While some start as jokes, they can gain real value due to community interest and speculation.

### **Indie.fun Overview:**

How does launching on Indie.fun work

**How does indie.fun help indie game developers** 

**Indie.fun** is a game launchpad designed to help independent (indie) game developers raise funding, build communities, and showcase their games more effectively. Here’s how:

1. **Fair-Launch Funding:**  
    Indie.fun provides a token-based crowdfunding model that allows developers to raise capital from a wide pool of backers. By fairly distributing tokens, it ensures developers have access to the funds they need to continue working on the game 

2. **Community Building:**  
    Because of its open, blockchain-driven model, Indie.fun invites a broad audience of gamers and enthusiasts who are excited to discover and support indie titles. Developers can connect with new fans, gather feedback, and foster stronger engagement.

3. **Low Technical Barriers:**  
    Even if a developer is unfamiliar with web3 technology, Indie.fun streamlines the process. From simplified onboarding to clear documentation, it’s designed to be accessible to traditional Web2 game creators.

Overall, Indie.fun acts as a bridge between indie devs, players, and speculators with risk willing capital—helping studios secure funding, connect with a broader community, and ultimately bring their game ideas to life.

### GTM for your indie.fun game:

**What social media to use:**  
In web3 gaming there are 3 common social media that everyone use. That is Twitter / X, Telegram, and Discord. For your game to successfully launch on, you must have a Twiter / X profile for it, will go in more detail on good tips later. 

Besides Twitter, you also need a platform where your community can interact with each other. This is where Telegram and Discord come into play. You really only need one of them to start off. We recommend telegram if your game is lightweight and ultra-casual. But discord is a good option for more organized communication if you are building something more complex with more depth to it.

**How to kick start a social presence on Twitter**    
Make an introduction post with some visual content that showcase what you built. A banner is good but a trailer is even better. Check out this [case study](https://x.com/memelandmayhem/status/1879568907285004739)
