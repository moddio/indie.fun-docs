# Verification Badge

The Indie.fun verification badge is a yellow checkmark shown on a project’s profile to confirm that the project creator has completed our identity verification process.

---

## What the Badge Means

The badge confirms that:

- The person behind the project has verified their identity with Indie.fun
- They control the associated Twitter account
- They have submitted the required verification information and completed a live video check-in

**It does not imply that Indie.fun endorses, approves, or evaluates the quality, credibility, or potential of the project.** Backers should always conduct their own research before supporting any project.

## What the Badge Does *Not* Mean

- It does **not** represent a recommendation or guarantee
- It does **not** indicate project performance, legitimacy, or safety

## How to Apply for a Verification Badge

To request a verification badge, project creators must:

1. **Send a direct message to [@indiedotfun](https://twitter.com/indiedotfun)** from their official project Twitter account
2. **Join a brief video call** to confirm their identity
3. **Complete a verification form** that includes personal and project information

This process helps us ensure accountability and prevent impersonation or fraudulent project listings.

## Backers: Always DYOR

Even if a project has a verification badge, backers should **always do their own research (DYOR)** before contributing.

Verification only confirms identity — it does not assess risk, performance, or execution.

## Final Notes

Indie.fun reserves the right to approve, deny, or revoke verification at its sole discretion. We are committed to transparency, creator empowerment, and protecting our community.
